## 2. Q-target
The μ-cavity prototype aims for a quality factor of approximately $6\times10^6$ and a mode volume near $0.02\,\text{cm}^3$. Achieving this level requires careful material selection, surface treatment, and shielding to suppress dielectric loss and ambient magnetic noise. The parameters are based on extrapolations from the current cavity dataset in `result/opt_design.json` and include margin for integration into a pump-driven boost stage.

## 3. Integration Goals into 8Q Platform
Once the prototype passes cold testing, it will be aligned with the 8-qubit experimental platform. The timeline anticipates final device delivery in mid-August, followed by interface checks with the existing control electronics. Success will be measured by verifying the targeted $Q$ and mode volume while ensuring compatibility with the boost circuitry described in D-4. The ultimate objective is to reach a boost factor of roughly 12.5× when used in conjunction with flux-pump drive, paving the way for the follow-on 16Q design.
